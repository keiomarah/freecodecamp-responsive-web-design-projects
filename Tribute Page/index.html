                    <p>Beauvoir had an instrumental role in modern feminist philosophy especially with her book <i>The Second Sex</i> which was foundational in the gender-sex distinction in popular discourse. She argued "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman" which helped launch second-wave feminism by establishing gener as a social construct rather than an inherent biological characteristic.
                    She was also an active figure in other areas such as existentialism, literature, and social theory.</p>
