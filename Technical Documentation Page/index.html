            <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. 
                It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, and system scripting. 
                The language works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). It has a simple syntax similar to the English 
                language and allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an 
                interpreter system, meaning the code cna be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be 
                very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>
                <p>The most recent major version of Python is <span class="links"><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="blank">Python 3</a></span>, which we shall be using 
                in this tutorial.</p>

            <p>An important aspect of Python syntax is indentation. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other 
                programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python 
                uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
            <pre><code>
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")  
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                You can use print() function to display text or output values. Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can
                use either " " double quotes or ' ' single quotes.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
x = 25
    print("Hello World!") #Hello World!
    print(x) #25
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>If you forget to put the text inside quotes, Python will give an error.</p>
            <p>You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
print("I am", 35, "years old.") #I am 35 years old.

            <header><h2 id="comments-heading">Comments</h2></header>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code and can be used to make the code more readable.
                Comments can also be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
                <p>
                    Single line comments start with a #. Python does not really have a syntax for 
                    multiline comments. You can use a multiline string since Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to
                    a variable.

            <p>
                Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable. 
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared 
                with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
x = 5
y = "John"

            <p>
                In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store 
                data of different types, and different types can do different things. 
                Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories.
            </p>
            <div class="table-wrap">

            <header><h2 id="casting-heading">Casting</h2></header>
            <p>
                There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with 
                casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, 
                including its primitive types.
            </p>
            <p>Casting in Python is therefore done using constructor functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float 
                    literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
                </li>
                <li>
                    float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal 
                    (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
                </li>
                <li>
                    str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of unicode characters. 
                However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
                Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[2]) #l
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>To get the length of a string, use the len() function.</p>
            <p>To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt) #True
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character. An escape character 
                is a backlash \ followed by the character you want to insert. An example of an illegal character is 
                a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
                </code>

            <p>
                In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False. 
                You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
                When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
print(10 > 9) #True
print(10 == 9) #False
print(10 < 9) #False
                </code>
            </pre>

            <header><h2 id="operators-heading">Operators</h2></header>
            <p>
                Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python divides the operators in the following
                groups:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, etc</li>
                <li>Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, etc</li>
                <li>Comparison operators: >, <, ==, <==, etc</li>
                <li>Logical operators: and, or, not</li>
                <li>Identity operators: is, is not</li>
                <li>Membership operators: in, not in</li>
                <li>Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, etc</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Arrays" class="main-section" aria-labelledby="arrays-heading">
            <header><h2 id="arrays-heading">Arrays</h2></header>
            <p>Python does not have built-in support for Arrays but has 4 data types used to store collections of data namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lists</li>
                <li>Tuples</li>
                <li>Sets</li>
                <li>Dictionaries</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>List</h3>
            <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are created using square brackets. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
                List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item [1], etc.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Tuples</h3>
            <p>
                Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
                Tuples are written with round brackets.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Sets</h3>
            <p>
                Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
                Sets are written with curly brackets.
            </p>
            <p>* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
            <p>
                Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
                A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
                Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

        <section id="Decisions" class="main-section" aria-labelledby="decisions-heading">
            <header><h2 id="decisions-heading">Decisions</h2></header>
            <p>Python has two decision-making structures: If...Else statement and Match statement.</p>
            <h3>Python If Statement</h3>
            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equals: a == b</li>
                <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
                <li>Less than: a < b</li>
                <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
                <Li>Greater than: a > b</Li>
                <Li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</Li>
            </ul>
            <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Match Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The match statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
                 of writing many if..else statements, you can use the match statement.
                 The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
match expression:
  case x:
    code block
  case y:
    code block
  case z:
    code block
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This is how it works:</p>
            <uL>
                <li>The match expression is evaluated once.</li>
                <li>The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.</li>
                <li>If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.</li>
            </uL>
        </section>
        <section id="Iteration" class="main-section" aria-labelledby="iteration-heading">
            <header><h2 id="iteration-heading">Iteration</h2></header>
            <p>Python has two statements that support iteration: While loops and For loops.</p>
            <h3>While Loops</h3>
            <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <p>
                A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
                With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

                A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called and can return data as a result. A function helps avoiding code repetition.

            <p>
                In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This creates a function named my_function that prints "Hello from a function" when called.</p>
            <P>To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses:</P>
            <pre>

def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
